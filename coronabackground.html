On 31 December 2019 a cluster of cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei, was confirmed to the World 
Health Organization (WHO) by health authorities in China, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020. 
The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the WHO on 30 January—7,818 
cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.

Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market had seen some of the early cases and so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic basis. 
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS‐CoV‐2, a recently identified virus that is closely related to bat 
coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The scientific consensus is that COVID-19 originates from nature. The 
probable bat-to-human contamination may have been in the manufacture of traditional Chinese medicines by people who 
harvest bat carcasses and guano.

This was later revealed that the earliest identified person with symptoms had fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person 
had no apparent associations with the later wet market party. For the early cluster for cases identified that month 
,two thirds were found to have a market-related relation. An unverified article from the South China Morning Post on 13 
March 2020 indicated that a case dating back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person to get infected.

On 11 March 2020, the WHO recognized COVID-19 erupted as a pandemic. Surging cases registered by Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan. 
Within China's overall figures soon exceeded the China's.
